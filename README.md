# COMP2042_CW_scyda1

This README file is made by Donald Agustino student ID 20314803. 

To compile the code, you first need to download the javaFX library from https://openjfx.io/ according to your device specification. Afterwards, open your project in IntelliJ and click on File then Project Structure then click on the + sign and add the downloaded javaFX lib folder only, click apply and ok. Once all of this is done, your project should be able to run.

The javadoc exists inside the root directory of the project.

Some of the features that are implemented and are working properly are:
- Making a win state which is when reaching the 2048 cell
- Making the MainMenu class and new buttons to be functional
- Making buttons for the leveling of the game Hard: 6x6, Medium: 5x5 and Easy: 4x4
- Making accounts and leaderboard visible to user
- Making leaderboard to be able to be sorted per levels and adding interactive colors for the 
  user interface

All features implemented are working properly.

Some features that are not able to be implemented due to time constraint are login function and making a state where users could see the end state of the game when it is game over for them.
